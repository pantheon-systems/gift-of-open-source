# Contributor's Guide

The **Gift of Open Source**, a virtual event hosted by Pantheon, encourages participation in the open source community during the month of December. 

## What can I contribute?
The Gift of Open Source is open to everyone in our global community.
Whether you’re a developer, student learning to code, event host, or just someone looking to have fun, you can help drive growth of open source and make positive contributions to the community.
All backgrounds and skill levels are encouraged to participate.

To get involved, submit two pull requests to any open source project hosted on GitHub.com with the `Gift-of-Open-Source` topic, between December 1 and December 31 (11:59 PM PST) in 2021. 


## How to Contribute?

Make atleast **2** quality contributions to a participating repository and you'll get a prize! Here's how to get involved in 3 simple steps:

1. [Register to participate](https://pantheon.io/gift-open-source#register)
1. [Create a pull request](https://opensource.com/article/19/7/create-pull-request-github) in any participating repository. The repo must have a `Gift-of-Open-Source` topic, and the issue must have a `gift-of-open-source` label or `giftofopensource` tag. Make a contribution like improving existing implementations, fixing bugs, updating documentation, etc...
